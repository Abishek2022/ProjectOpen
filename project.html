                   <h3>PV savings report '23</h3>
                    <p>with Daniel Orubo, Boluwatife Akindele, Oris Aigbokhaevbolo, Blessed Adudu, Ayodotun Ajala, Odunayo Eweniyi, Joshua Chibueze, Somto Ifezue.</p>
                    <p>In late 2023, PiggyVest launched its Savings Report, a deep dive into Nigeria's financial habits across key areas such as debt, savings, black tax, expenses, gifts, and income. As the sole designer, I collaborated closely with the Content Team at PiggyVest to bring this project to life. The design challenge was to transform a data-heavy report into a fun and interactive experience that would engage users and spark conversations. To achieve this, I focused on creating an easy-to-read report with standout call-outs and creative data visualizations. Our initiative not only captivated audiences with valuable insights but also earned a spot on the Trend Table on X. Within the first 24 hours, the report attracted over 105K views and led to a remarkable increase of 10K+ new signups to the companyâ€™s newsletter.</p>
